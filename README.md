# Growth Analysis: MercadoLibre
The aim of this project is to use visualizations to predict trends and use a Prophet forecast model to predict growth. The goal is determine seasonality and correlation between Google Search Traffic and the company stock price.

## About
MercadoLibre is the top e-commerce platform in Latin America. This project will visualize and predict trends realated to the company and how they might correlate to the company stock price. The main Python libraries that will be used are hvPlot and prophet. hvPlot will be the main package to create the visualizations and prohet will be used to create a model that can be used to forecast future values. By understanding the underlying causes, specific actions could be put in place at the right time to increase the company's growth.

## Getting Started
To run the Jupyter notebook and interact with the visualizations and models, you need to have the following software and Python libraries installed:

- Python 3.10 or later
- Anaconda Distribution
- Pandas
- hvPlot
- holoviews
- prophet

## Installing
1. Install the latest verion of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the latest version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

3. Installing Anaconda includes the Pandas package.

4. To install the hvPlot, holoviews and prophet packages, run the following command in your terminal.

```
pip install prophet
pip install hvplot
pip install holoviews
```

## Usage
> **_NOTE:_**  The visualizations of the interactive plots do not show up in the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. Please clone or download the project to interact with the plots.

You can clone or download this GitHub project and open the `forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is seperated into sections that cover different aspects of the analysis. Each section contains explanations, code snippets, and interactive visualizations. By executing each cell in the Jupyter Notebook you can then interact with the visualizations.
